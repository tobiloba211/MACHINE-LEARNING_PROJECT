    "Facial recognition is a biometric technology used to identify or verify a personâ€™s identity using their face. It analyzes facial features such as the distance between the eyes, nose shape, jawline, and other unique characteristics to match it with a stored facial database. This technology is widely used in various applications, including:\n",

    "- **Authentication** (e.g., unlocking phones, access to secure buildings)\n",

    "The **Viola-Jones algorithm** is one of the most popular and efficient methods for real-time object detection, particularly for faces. It was proposed by **Paul Viola** and **Michael Jones** in 2001 and is widely used due to its speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts of Viola-Jones Algorithm**:\n",
    "- **Haar-like features**: These are simple rectangular features that represent changes in intensity between areas of an image. The algorithm uses thousands of these features to detect objects.\n",
    "- **Integral image**: This data structure is used to compute Haar-like features quickly.\n",
    "- **AdaBoost classifier**: It selects the most important features from the large set of Haar features and uses them to create a strong classifier.\n",
    "- **Cascade structure**: The classifier is arranged in stages, where each stage progressively narrows down regions that are likely to contain a face, making it efficient for real-time detection."
